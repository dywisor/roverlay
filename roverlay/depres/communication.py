"""basic communication methods to a dependency resolver

Provides two base classes that can be used for concrete communication classes:
* DependencyResolverListener -- an object that listens to the resolver.
                                It's not able to start communication with
                                the resolver, but useful to react on events
                                like 'dependency is unresolvable'.
* DependencyResolverChannel  -- an object that can interact with the resolver,
                                e.g. queue dependencies for resolution,
                                wait for results, parse them and send them
                                to the other end.
