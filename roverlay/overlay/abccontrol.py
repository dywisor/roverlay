   # for package_info-level checks,
   #  addition control can "recommend" the following actions
   #  (restricted-inclusive-or; priority as listed in descending order,
   #  or, more formal, lower integer > 0 means higher priority (and 0 having
   #  the lowest priority))
   #
   #  Note that any value v with bool(v)==False should be interpreted as
   #  keep-default-behavior.
   #  However, at addition-control-rule level, v==None means "rule does
   #  not care about package", whereas v==PKG_DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR means
   #  "force default behavior".
   #  Currently, there's no difference between None/bool(v)==False,
   #  as addition control is handled by package rules only.
   #

   # force-deny           -- always deny the package
   # deny-replace         -- accept new packages only (**)
   # force-replace        -- always replace existing ebuilds (***)
   # revbump-on-collision -- forced revbump if an ebuild exists already
   # default-behavior     -- no addition control
   #
   # (**)  in this context, "replace" includes revbump checks
   # (***) does not trigger revbump logic
   #
   # force-deny should not be used in package rules,
   #  because it is inferior to the "do-not-process" action.
   #  (package_info objects have to be kept in memory only to get rejected
   #  in package_dir.add_package(), while "do-not-process" filters them out
   #  immediately)
   # There are two use cases, though:
   # * in package rules: collapsed branches
   #                      (level1 sets force-deny, level2 resets it)
   # * if the control result depends on the package being replaced
   #    (equal to deny-replace, but faster)
