# repo.list
#  This file explains how to write repo config files.

# This file is parsed used ConfigParser syntax (known from .ini files).

# A repo entry describes
# * where to find R packages that will be used for overlay creation,
#    and optionally where and how to get the R packages (using repo types)
# * how ebuilds can download the R packages (=> SRC_URI)

# Each repository is introduced with [<section name>] and has to declare
# some options.
#
# general options are:
#
# * required:
#
#   src_uri   -- this is used to determine the SRC_URI in ebuilds
#                 (SRC_URI=<src_uri>/<package file name>)
#                 FIXME note: check that subdirs are handled correctly
#
# * optional:
#
#   name      -- name of the repository
#                 optional, defaults to <section name>
#   type      -- the type of this repo, see below
#                 optional, defaults to rsync
#   directory -- the local package directory,
#                 optional, defaults to <DISTFILES ROOT (from config)>/<name>
#
#   (base_uri -- don't use, to be removed)
#
#
# There are two types of repos, "rsync" and "local" ones:
#
# * Local repo;
#   A Local repo represents a directory with R packages in it.
#   It will never be modified (i.e. synced) and has no special options.
#
# * Rsync repo:
#   An Rsync repo uses a local directory to sync with a remote.
#   Its directory will be modified whenever syncing (using the rsync program).
#   Behaves like a local repo if syncing is disabled.
#
#  default rsync options (always passed to rsync):
#   --links, --safe-links, --times, --compress, --dirs, --prune-empty-dirs,
#   --force, --delete, --human-readable, --stats, --chmod=ugo=r,u+w,Dugo+x
#
#  This type has special options:
#
#  rsync_uri        -- required, rsync uri
#  recursive        -- optional, passes '--recursive' to rsync
#                       if this option is set to 'yes'
#  extra_rsync_opts -- optional options to pass to rsync, this
#                       can be used to exclude/include files,
#                       show progress while syncing etc.
#                       Note: options cannot contain whitespace! (#FIXME note: this could be allowed if useful)
#

# == Repo entry examples ==

# a local directory with packages in /var/www/R_packages
#
#[local_packages]
#type      = local
#src_uri   = http://localhost/R_packages
#directory = /var/www/R_packages


# a local directory with packages manually downloaded from CRAN
# * directory will be automatically set to <DISTROOT>/CRAN/selected
#
#[CRAN/selected]
#type    = local
#src_uri = http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib

# CRAN rsync repo
# * type will be set to rsync
# * directory will be set to <DISTROOT>/CRAN/all
# * rsync progress will be shown during transfer
# * not recursive, the package archive and R release won't be fetched
# * this needs about 2.5G disk space
#
#[CRAN/all]
#src_uri   = http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib
#rsync_uri = cran.r-project.org::CRAN/src/contrib
#extra_rsync_opts = --progress

# CRAN rsync repo (selective transfer)
# * type is explicitly set to rsync
# * only packages starting with "r" or "R" will be fetched
# * directory will be set to <DISTROOT>/CRAN/only_letter_R
# * rsync progress will be shown during transfer
# * not recursive
# * this needs about 300M disk space
