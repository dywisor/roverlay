R overlay -- README

== How to use ==

There is currently no "R overlay" script, only modules that implement functionality.

=== Running tests ===

Real tests are scheduled for July 10 - July 30.

In the meantime, there are some test scripts (run_<something>.py,test_<something>.sh)
and a Makefile that provide basic testing.

To run them you need to create a directory <root>/examples/packages and
put some R packages into it (expected suffix is .tar.gz),
where <root> is the directory containing this README file.

You can then run:
	make <some test>
	 where <some test> is
	 * test-nop             -- tries to import roverlay, but does nothing
	 * test-ebuild_creation -- tries to create an ebuild for each package in examples/packages
	 * test-ebuild_creation -- tries to create 1000 ebuilds for each package in examples/packages
	 * test                 -- runs all of the above tests
	 * dummy                -- prints python version in use, run
	                            make PYVER=2 <some test> or make PYVER=3 <some test>
	                            use a specific one

	or:
	./test_ebuildcreation.sh [-q] [count]
	                        -- runs count * "number of packages in examples/packages"
	                           ebuild creations in one script call.
	                           Use '-q' to suppress the script output (e.g. ebuilds).

	./run_ebuildcreation.py <packages>
									-- runs ebuild creations for the given packages
